Classic Simon Game
A Simon Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript Thanks to Beau Carnes of FreeCodeCamp for the tutorial for the JavaScript. 
I made modifications to the HTML and CSS and recorded and used my own sounds. I also recorded a custom "error" sound
for when you click the wrong color and added that to the JavaScript.
Additional thanks to liubowolkova@codecademy who made some suggestions to help eliminate repeated code. :)
